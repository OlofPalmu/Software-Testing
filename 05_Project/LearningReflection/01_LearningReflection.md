> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 
    It was kind of pleasent experience, instructions was a little bit hard to understand but I did my best and hope that will give me the best resault.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?
-  I used Visual Studio Code and proceeded as instructions said. Wrote down step by step what i was doing while I was testing.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management, 
 -     I really don't have any recommends about tools or styles.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I personally used Visual Studio Code because I have used it in every coding exercise since I started studying BIT.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-   All the troubles I found was in the negative testing but the webapp gave the answers quickly what needs to be done to make it work correctly.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-   I have used GitHub with couple of courses before. Mostly for web pages.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
-   I don't have any opinions about these but maybe try to use Cypress because I have heard good things about it from friends.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
-   Mostly i keep seeing job applications that requires knowledge and experience with python and Robot Framework.



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I need to complete the python course of course, but take more advanced courses about software testing because I think my weakness is the most important side of the job, the technical side.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-   I have learned a lot about software testing in this course and I think this last project helped to understand it even more deeply. I still think that these kind of courses should be classroom teaching, mostly because I think I can get more from it that way but also because this course still requires a lot of time and focus if you want to take full advantage of it. Summary, I personally liked this course and would recommend it. Hopefully this course can be classroom teaching in the future!
