
## Summary (Summarize the bug encountered concisely)

    There is a minor typo mistake in the GitLab project page. When you are trying to create a new project
    and when you land on the page where you can select the type of the project, it says 'Create black project'
    instead of 'Create blank project'. I assume that this is a typo. I think it would be pretty crucial to fix asap
    so there woudln't be any misunderstandings.


## Steps to reproduce

    There should be someone who proofreads the pages before releasing. The one who coded it or someone else.     

## Example Project

## What is the current bug behavior?

     There is not a functional error or any kind of that, this is just a typo mistake and it is only visual. But it may cause misunderstandings.

## What is the expected correct behavior?

    Instead of 'Create BLACK project' it should be 'Create BLANK project'.
